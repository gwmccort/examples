=== Issues
. proxy error trying to do `up`
.. tried http://tmatilai.github.io/vagrant-proxyconf/[Proxy Configuration Plugin for Vagrant], but it didn't work :-(
.. needed to add http_proxy to Vagrantfile


== Proxy
* proxy for shell to be able to do a `vagrant up` at work
----
export http_proxy=http://proxy:9090
export https_proxy=http://proxy:9090

To get more deeply into it, you can look at /etc/rc.d/rc.3. You'll see a bunch of symbolic links beginning with either k or s. Those with s are started at boot in runlevel 3.
