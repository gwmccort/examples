Simple Microservice Example
===

This is the source code for [_Microservices with Apache Camel, Spring Boot and Docker_](http://sixtree.com.au/articles/2016/microservices-springboot-camel-docker/) blog post on Sixtree webiste.

Using Groovy, Gradle, Apache Camel, Spring Boot and Docker, we demonstrate how to quickly create a microservice.

The microservice exposes a REST API for interacting with an in-memory H2 Database.

To run the application through Spring Boot (not Docker):

	$ gradle bootRun

To build the Docker image for the project:

	$ gradle buildDocker

To run the container for the above image:

	$ docker run -p 8080:8080 thing-service
